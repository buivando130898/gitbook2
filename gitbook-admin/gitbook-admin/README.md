## <mark style="color:purple;">The initiation</mark>

For as long as any of us can remember, the snakes have been lurking their way through the tropical rainforests, slithering across the scorching deserts, hiding in the rice fields, or crawling high above on the rocky mountains.

Considered one of the most dangerous and mysterious species on the planet, the snakes have gone into myths, folklore, and also became the symbol of divinity in many religions.

The Chronicle of Naga is not just a game but also a song of praise for the beauty, individuality, and survivability of the snakes. Each player will immerse in the experience through snakes and appreciate their struggle through evolution along some of the most famous rivers in the world; where each river tells the stories of a different civilization, a different history, and a different culture.
