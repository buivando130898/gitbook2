# Hunt Mode

Player chooses 1-5 snakes in their collection to auto-hunt items on the map to earn bonus points and later exchange them for $NAGA tokens.

Snakes lose STAMINA while hunting and would go to sleep when STAMINA = 0. To recover STAMINA, the snake must be manually removed from hunt by the player.
