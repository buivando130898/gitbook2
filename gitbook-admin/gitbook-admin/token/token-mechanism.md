# Token mechanism

## <mark style="color:green;">Current token mechanism</mark>

Most of the P2E games in the market are implementing one the following mechanisms&#x20;

&#x20;       \- Dual token, one for governance, the other for earning purpose (Example: Axie Infinities with AXS/SLP; Sidus Heroes with SIDUS/SENATE)&#x20;

&#x20;        \- Single token mechanism: CRYOWAR, Guild of Guardiance â€“ GOG)

## <mark style="color:green;">Our token mechanism</mark>

We are implementing one and a half token mechanism model with NAGA is the on-chain currency and NIT (Naga In-Games Token) is the off-chain point system.

The benefit of running such a mechanism is the ability of inflation control, whale control, estimating the break event point for user
